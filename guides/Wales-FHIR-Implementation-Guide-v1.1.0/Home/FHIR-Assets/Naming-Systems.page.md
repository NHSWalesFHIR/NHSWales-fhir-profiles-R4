The following published Naming Systems are for use within Wales. 

## UK Wide Terminology Services

There are several namespaces used throughout this guide that are UK based which can be found on the [UK Naming Systems](https://simplifier.net/guide/uknamingsystems) page. These are not maintained by NHS Wales.


## OIDs

Data Standards Wales is responsible for the creation of namespaces and OIDs for NHS Wales systems. If you require one to be created please contact them using the email on the {{pagelink:Home/Help-and-Support/Help-and-Support.page.md,text:help and support}} page and ask for the link to the request form (internal to NHS Wales).

As there are several hundred systems currently registered with OIDs it has been decided that they will not all be added as naming systems. To be pragmatic, we have added the most used, high-level system identifiers shared between systems. Please remember that identifiers are extensible so you are not limited to only referencing the below namespaces. Further information can be found on the {{pagelink:Home/Design/Naming-Systems.page.md}} design page.

### NHS Wales Identity Provider User ID (also known as NADEX)

The above identifier has not been included in this guide as its use for identifying healthcare professionals (HCPs) is discouraged. The HCPs professional registration number should be used as their primary identifier in all scenarios. If you feel that you must use this identifier in a FHIR resource, please contact {{pagelink:Home/Help-and-Support/Help-and-Support.page.md,text:Data Standards Wales}} and we can discuss the available options.
